# Flimsy Billy's Coin Dash 3: Super Tag 3 Electric Tree
Welcome to the famed FLimsy Billy's Coin Dash! This is a silly game where you battle against time to collect 50 coins, but 1 coin
disappears from your inventory every second! Explore the different parts of the map and buy exciting potions! But, 
beware, choose the wrong door when you leave the mysterious Jungle Room and you will lose half of your coins! Use the
potions wisely. Sometimes it is more efficient to use the potions.

### How To Play
To play *Flimsy Billy's Coin Dash 3: Super Tag 3 Electric Tree* you must control Flimsy Billy around the game world
with the `W` `A` `S` and `D` keys. When you click play you are loaded into the Bar Round. Here you set the bar
for the next round. Try to get as many coins as possible in as small amount of time as possible. When you are done,
go to the portal at the top left of the shop and travel through to the next round. In this round you will have to get
more coins than in the last round, but in the same amount of time. If you can, you win! If you can't, you lose. Try
out potions, some will allow you to get to coins that you haven't before, or some will make other places easier
to get the coins from. There is even a potion that takes you to a secret room. Note: every 5 seconds you lose 1 coin!
